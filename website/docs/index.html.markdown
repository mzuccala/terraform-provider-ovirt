# oVirt Provider
The oVirt provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by oVirt. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the oVirt Provider
provider "ovirt" {
  url      = "https://engine-api/ovirt-engine/api"
  username = "admin@internal"
  password = "thepassword"
  headers  {
      filter      = true
      all_content = true
  }
}

# Create a VM
resource "ovirt_vm" "test-vm" {
    # ...
}
```

## Configuration Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `url` - (Required) The oVirt engine API URL. If omitted, the `OVIRT_URL` environment variable is used.
* `username` - (Required) The username for accessing oVirt engine API. If omitted, the `OVIRT_USERNAME` environment variable is used.

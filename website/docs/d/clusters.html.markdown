# Data Source: ovirt\_clusters

The oVirt Clusters data source allows access to details of list of clusters within oVirt.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ovirt_clusters" "filtered_clusters" {
    name_regex = "^default*"
	
    search     = {
	  criteria       = "architecture = x86_64 and Storage.name = data"
	  max            = 2
	  case_sensitive = false
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name_regex` - (Optional) The fully functional regular expression for name
* `search` - (Optional) The general search criteria representation, fitting the rules of [Searching](http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/master/#_searching)
    * criteria - (Optional) The criteria for searching, using the same syntax as the oVirt query language
    * max - (Optional) The maximum amount of objects returned. If not specified, the search will return all the objects.
    * case_sensitive - (Optional) If the search are case sensitive, default value is `false`

> The `search.criteria` also supports asterisk for searching by name, to indicate that any string matches, including the empty string. For example, the criteria `search=name=myobj*` will return all the objects with names beginning with `myobj`, such as `myobj2`, `myobj-test`. So, you could use `name_regex` for searching by complicated regular expression, and `search.criteria` for simple case accordingly.

## Attributes Reference

`clusters` is set to the wrapper of the found clusters. Each item of `clusters` contains the following attributes exported:

* `id` - The ID of oVirt Cluster

* `datacenter_id` - The ID of oVirt Datacenter the cluster belongs to
